1. Setup Instructions

Start off with the usual:

`npm install`

To run the data-streaming service, run the following command:

`npm run start-streamer`

This will start up the streaming service on port 3030. Build the UI, and start it up with:

`npm run build`
`npm run start-prod`

The web application will then be available at http://localhost:8080
The core of the application is in the src/ folder (this is the only place you should need to make changes in). The front-end main file is src/client.js
